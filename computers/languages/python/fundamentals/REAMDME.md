# Python Fundamentals

## 

The [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) is the number one place to go for any questions. These notes are more like a cheatsheet for concepts already learned. 

Python is a dynamically typed, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Combined with its human readable syntax and interpreted nature, it's a great language to learn and use. 

The [reference manual](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html) states that a Python program is read by a _parser_, which receives a stream of tokens generated by the _lexical analyzer_. 

Lines are ended by the __NEWLINE__ token. However, to make code more human readable, one can use the ```(\)``` backslash character to escape the token. Note that a line ending in a backslash __cannot__ carry a comment. 

Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a "logical line" is used to determine grouping of statements. The indentation levels generate __INDENT__ and __DEDENT__ tokens. 

Other tokens include: _identifiers_, _keywords_, _literals_, _operators_, and _delimiters_.
