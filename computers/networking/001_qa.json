Smart contracts execute automatically on each node and provide a platform for building business applications like cryptocurrencies.\n\n3. **Consensus Layer**: Deals with distributed consensus to ensure trustworthiness of blocks and that all nodes have consistent ledger copies. It resolves disagreements between network nodes caused by faults, delays, or malicious nodes.\n\n4. **Network Layer**: Provides distributed network architecture by forming a P2P network based on communication protocols like TCP/IP, enabling nodes to communicate and share data.\n\n5. **Data Layer**: Collects data from the lower layer through transactions, encapsulates it with data layer headers, and digitally signs the data for authentication and integrity purposes.\n\n6. **Device Layer**: Represents the hardware or physical devices such as sensors, actuators, and networking hardware that can be connected with wires or wirelessly, similar to the physical layer in the OSI model.",

        "question": "Compare and contrast the two main DLT data structures: Blockchain and Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG). Discuss how each structure organizes transactions, validates new entries, and what advantages or characteristics each provides.",
        "answer": "**Blockchain Structure**:\nBlockchain forms a chain of blocks or linked lists with hashes. Each block contains all recent transactions that have occurred within the last couple of seconds or minutes. The hash of all transactions in a block generates a Merkle Tree data structure, with the tree's root pointed to in the block. Blockchain is an append-only data structure where all new transactions are appended to the tree, creating an immutable log of the entire transaction history in the network. This structure provides strong security through cryptographic linking and makes it extremely difficult to alter historical records.\n\n**Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) Structure**:\nDAG is a comparatively less popular data structure for distributed transactions. The graph starts with a beginning transaction that is approved directly or indirectly by other transactions in the graph. When a new transaction is submitted, it must validate two previous transactions that were not yet approved. This creates a web-like structure rather than a linear chain.\n\n**Key Differences**:\n- Blockchain uses a linear, sequential structure while DAG uses a graph-based structure\n- Blockchain appends new transactions to blocks, while DAG requires new transactions to validate previous ones\n- Blockchain is more established and widely used, while DAG is less popular but potentially offers different scalability characteristics\n- Both provide immutability but achieve it through different structural mechanisms",
